Welcome to Platinum Casino!

This is a virtual Casino where you start with $1000 and can make a lot of money and then quit

Blackjack
A computer will generate 2 random cards 1-11. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as can without going over because if you go over you bust and lose. The dealer/computer has to keep pulling cards until it gets to any number from 17-21. You can hit to get another card or stand to stay at the same number that your cards add up to.

Slots
Welcome to slots, the game is very simple and for the most part it is luck based, you will enter your stake/wager and then the computer will 3 lines of 3 numbers in each, if 3 in the line are the same then you will win 100 times the amount that you wagered but if they are not then you will lose your wager.

Roulette
In this game you enter first what you want to bet on, you have the choice to bet on either an odd/even numbers/ a specific number (0-36), or you can bet on a color, you can bet on red, or black which both appear 18 times on the board or if you are feeling lucky you can bet on green which only appears on the board once but has a much greater reward.

You can quit at the end to leave with your winnings
